# EmsiPostingScraper

The purpose of this repository is to develop a web crawler that scrapes job posting information from the Emsi site (<a href="https://jobs.lever.co/economicmodeling/">https://jobs.lever.co/economicmodeling/<\a>). This program relys on the Python programming language, along with the scrapy and beautiful frameworks. The output of the product is a JSON file (EmsiJobPosts_2021_02_18.json), which can be visualized in the jupyter notebook (VisualizeJobData.ipynb).
